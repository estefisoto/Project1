Welcome to the Connection Program!

If you are having trouble connecting to your program follow these guidlines:

To show a map of the guts of a java program, simply hit 'Connect' located
under 'File' in the menu bar.

We can only run programs saved in a NetBeans project so if you haven't 
used your file as part of a project please do so and build the project once
you have added your file.  

When you hit 'connect' you will be asked to locate a file.  This file will be
in your NetBeans project folder and will have a .class extension so if you
are running 'Main.java' be sure to open 'Main.class'

Once you have located and selected the file you will be asked to write the 
package name your file was added to in NetBeans.  

Your program will appear on screen! To save it simply click on 'File' 'Save Image'

If there are any problems connecting make sure your program has a main file and that
it is building in netbeans.
